### What is SATORI?

Satori is a Discord bot that analyzes messages sent across your server. 

Server admins can check any member's score with `/score [member]`, while members can view their own score with `/score`. 
<br>Simple and unobtrusive, Satori works quietly in the background to provide insight into communication patterns.

### Why is it useful?
Helps manage large Discord servers by providing transparency into message patterns, allowing admins to take action based on behavior scores or even automatically.

### What is the advantage?
Unlike human moderators who can only monitor specific servers, Satori operates across multiple Discord communities simultaneously. This cross-server analysis means users are evaluated based on their behavior everywhere, that means preventing scenarios where someone maintains a positive reputation in one server while exhibiting toxic behavior in others.

## Run it
To make sure that the messages are scored correctly, run
`uvicorn message_sentiment:app --reload --port 3001` to start the sentiment analysis.
<br>and `npm run dev` to run the discord bot.
**MAKE SURE** to have a `.env` with `TOKEN=` and your discord bot token.
